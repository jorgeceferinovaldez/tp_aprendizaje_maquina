    "### Contexto\n",
    "En astronomía, la clasificación estelar es la clasificación de las estrellas en función de sus características espectrales. El esquema de clasificación de galaxias, quásares y estrellas es uno de los más fundamentales en astronomía. La catalogación temprana de las estrellas y su distribución en el cielo ha llevado a comprender que forman nuestra propia galaxia y, tras la distinción de que Andrómeda era una galaxia separada de la nuestra, se comenzaron a estudiar numerosas galaxias a medida que se construían telescopios más potentes. Este datasat tiene como objetivo clasificar estrellas, galaxias y quásares en función de sus características espectrales.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Contenido\n",
    "Los datos constan de 100.000 observaciones del espacio realizadas por el SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Cada observación se describe mediante 17 columnas de características y 1 columna de clase que la identifica como estrella, galaxia o quásar.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. obj_ID = Identificador de objeto, el valor único que identifica el objeto en el catálogo de imágenes utilizado por CAS\n",
    "2. alpha = ángulo de Ascensión Recta (en la época J2000)\n",
    "3. delta = ángulo de declinación (en la época J2000)\n",
    "4. u = Filtro ultravioleta en el sistema fotométrico\n",
    "5. g = Filtro verde en el sistema fotométrico\n",
    "6. r = Filtro rojo en el sistema fotométrico\n",
    "7. i = Filtro de infrarrojo cercano en el sistema fotométrico\n",
    "8. z = Filtro de infrarrojos en el sistema fotométrico\n",
    "9. run_ID = Número de ejecución utilizado para identificar el análisis específico\n",
    "10. rereun_ID = Número de repetición para especificar cómo se procesó la imagen\n",
    "11. cam_col = Columna de cámara para identificar la línea de exploración dentro de la ejecución\n",
    "12. field_ID = Número de campo para identificar cada campo\n",
    "13. spec_obj_ID = ID único utilizado para objetos espectroscópicos ópticos (esto significa que 2 observaciones diferentes con el mismo spec_obj_ID deben compartir la clase de salida)\n",
    "14. class = clase de objeto (galaxia, estrella u objeto cuásar)\n",
    "15. redshift = valor de corrimiento al rojo basado en el aumento de la longitud de onda\n",
    "16. plate = ID de placa, identifica cada placa en SDSS\n",
    "17. MJD = Fecha juliana modificada, utilizada para indicar cuándo se tomó un determinado dato del SDSS\n",
    "18. fiber_ID = ID de fibra que identifica la fibra que apuntó la luz al plano focal en cada observación\n",
